Card RPG game engine (Heartstone-based) by Artem Tokarevskikh (FIT CVUT B182)

This game-engine is simplified version of Heartstone by Blizzard.

In this version there's only three types of card: Weapon, Creature, Spell.
Players do not have different heroes to choose.
There's two types of game: player vs. player and player vs. computer
Player can throw to the table only Creature card. Player may have Weapon in "hand" and can attack with it. 
Spell eventually used. After spell was applied there're circumstances. If card was under attack, it cannot attack next round. Player loses all his mana after being attacked
Cards and players can attack other cards and players. 

Player can surrender or save game to finish it later. If you change Decks file, save can be damaged, so DO NOT DO IT.
